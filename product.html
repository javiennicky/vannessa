		<p>2. Convertibles:

In the market, there are various types of sports cars available, such as Convertibles, Hot hatch, Grand tourers, Sports saloons, Pony cars, and others. Among these cars, Convertibles or Cabriolets are some of the famous and luxurious ones. The unique feature that makes them appealing is their ability to convert into an open-air vehicle. With modern technology, many improvements have been made in the design of these cars. For instance, some convertibles use automatic hydraulic or electrical actuators, which make the conversion process smooth and effortless. Ferrari California, Honda S 200, BMW M 3, Mazda M X-5, and Volvo C 70 are some well-known convertibles that are loved by car enthusiasts.
